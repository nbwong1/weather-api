## Description

This challenge shall utilize my skills understanding html, css, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, and APIs in order to create an application that can fetch weather data. 

I have had difficulty loading data stored from my local storage into my page, but this is also a work in progress. 

In addition, I plan on providing more javascript to fetch the data from the Weather API.
